                <h2>Feature 1: Customer Demographic Information</h2>

                <p id="basicfeatures">One of the key features of the Evera API is the ability to analyze customer demographic information. This feature allows the API to take into account important factors such as age, gender, marital status, and location, when making its predictions.

                <h2>Feature A: Past Real Estate Purchases</h2>

                <h2>Feature C: Confidence Score</h2>
